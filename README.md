## vocab_builder
Build flashcard style sheets (in PDF) with vocabulary words  
The supporting wordXXX scripts organize the words into categories  
The builder is very hard-coded.  No means to accept input to change  
or limit sets of words or even filter words of a category set. For
the time being, print only what's necessary.
